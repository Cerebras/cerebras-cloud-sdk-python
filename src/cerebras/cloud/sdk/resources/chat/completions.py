        Args:
          disable_reasoning: Disables reasoning for reasoning models.

        If set to True, the model will not use
              any reasoning in its response.

          frequency_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on their
              existing frequency in the text so far, decreasing the model's likelihood to
              repeat the same line verbatim.

          logit_bias: Modify the likelihood of specified tokens appearing in the completion.

              Accepts a JSON object that maps tokens (specified by their token ID in the
              tokenizer) to an associated bias value from -100 to 100. Mathematically, the
              bias is added to the logits generated by the model prior to sampling. The exact
              effect will vary per model, but values between -1 and 1 should decrease or
              increase likelihood of selection; values like -100 or 100 should result in a ban
              or exclusive selection of the relevant token.

          logprobs: Whether to return log probabilities of the output tokens or not. If true,
              returns the log probabilities of each output token returned in the content of
              message.

          max_completion_tokens: An upper bound for the number of tokens that can be generated for a completion,
              including visible output tokens and reasoning tokens.

          max_tokens: The maximum number of tokens that can be generated in the chat completion. The
              total length of input tokens and generated tokens is limited by the model's
              context length. This value is now deprecated in favor of max_completion_tokens.

          min_completion_tokens: The minimum number of tokens to generate for a completion. If not specified or
              set to 0, the model will generate as many tokens as it deems necessary. Setting
              to -1 sets to max sequence length.

          min_tokens: The minimum number of tokens to generate for a completion. If not specified or
              set to 0, the model will generate as many tokens as it deems necessary. Setting
              to -1 sets to max sequence length.

          n: How many chat completion choices to generate for each input message. Note that
              you will be charged based on the number of generated tokens across all of the
              choices. Keep n as 1 to minimize costs.

          presence_penalty: Number between -2.0 and 2.0. Positive values penalize new tokens based on
              whether they appear in the text so far, increasing the model's likelihood to
              talk about new topics.

          reasoning_effort: Constrains effort on reasoning for reasoning models. Currently supported values
              are low, medium, and high. Reducing reasoning effort can result in faster
              responses and fewer tokens used on reasoning in a response. If set to None, the
              model will use the default reasoning effort for the model.

          seed: If specified, our system will make a best effort to sample deterministically,
              such that repeated requests with the same `seed` and parameters should return
              the same result. Determinism is not guaranteed.

          stop: Up to 4 sequences where the API will stop generating further tokens. The
              returned text will not contain the stop sequence.

          temperature: What sampling temperature to use, between 0 and 1.5. Higher values like 0.8 will
              make the output more random, while lower values like 0.2 will make it more
              focused and deterministic. We generally recommend altering this or `top_p` but
              not both.

          top_logprobs: An integer between 0 and 20 specifying the number of most likely tokens to
              return at each token position, each with an associated log probability. logprobs
              must be set to true if this parameter is used.

          top_p: An alternative to sampling with temperature, called nucleus sampling, where the
              model considers the results of the tokens with top_p probability mass. So 0.1
              means only the tokens comprising the top 10% probability mass are considered. We
              generally recommend altering this or `temperature` but not both.

          user: A unique identifier representing your end-user, which can help Cerebras to
              monitor and detect abuse.

          extra_headers: Send extra headers

          extra_query: Add additional query parameters to the request
